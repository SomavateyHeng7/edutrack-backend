## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING: Portal List Not Loading

### Backend Status (Verified Feb 19, 2026)
```bash
# Test: curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/public/graduation-portals
# Result: Returns 3 active portals ✅
```

### Common Frontend Issues

1. **Wrong API URL**
   - Check if frontend is calling `/api/public/graduation-portals` (not `/api/graduation-portals`)
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` or similar env var is correct

2. **CORS Issue**
   - Backend is configured for CORS in `config/cors.php`
   - Check browser console for CORS errors

3. **Response Field Names**
   - Response returns `{ portals: [...], total: N }`
   - Frontend should access `response.data.portals` or `response.portals`

4. **Network/Server**
   - Ensure Laravel server is running: `php artisan serve`
   - Check port matches frontend config (default: 8000)

### Expected Response Format
```json
{
  "portals": [
    {
      "id": "12",
      "name": "Portal Name",
      "description": "...",
      "batch": "653",
      "deadline": "2026-02-19",
      "daysRemaining": 0.21,
      "grace_period_end": "2026-02-26T00:00:00+00:00",
      "is_in_grace_period": false,
      "acceptedFormats": [".xlsx", ".xls", ".csv"],
      "maxFileSizeMb": 5,
      "curriculum": { "id": "...", "name": "...", "year": "..." } | null,
      "department": { "id": "...", "name": "..." } | null
    }
  ],
  "total": 3
}
```

---

## ⚙️ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

```env
# Session token validity (minutes) - how long after PIN verification
GRADUATION_SESSION_TTL=15

# Submission retention (days after portal deadline)
GRADUATION_SUBMISSION_RETENTION_DAYS=7

# Grace period (days after deadline students can still submit)
GRADUATION_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS=7

# IP validation for session security
GRADUATION_VALIDATE_IP=true
```

**Submission Lifecycle:**
- Student submits → stored with TTL = `portal.deadline + RETENTION_DAYS`
- On validate/approve/reject → TTL preserved (NOT deleted)
- Auto-deleted when TTL expires

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTED BACKEND CHANGES

### REQ-1: Submission Retention Change ✅

**Previous Behavior:** Submissions expired 30 minutes after submission (cache-based).

**New Behavior:** Submissions are retained until **1 week after the portal deadline**, then auto-deleted.

#### What Changed:

1. **`config/graduation.php`:**
   ```php
   // Changed from:
   'submission_ttl_minutes' => 30,
   
   // To:
   'submission_retention_days' => env('GRADUATION_SUBMISSION_RETENTION_DAYS', 7),
   ```

2. **`GraduationSubmissionController.php`:**
   - Added `calculateDeletionDate()` helper method
   - Updated `store()` method to calculate `expires_at` as `portal.deadline + 7 days`
   - Added `deletion_date` field to submission data and API response
   - Updated `addToPortalSubmissionList()` to use Carbon datetime instead of TTL minutes

3. **API Response Changes:**
   ```json
   {
     "submission": {
       "id": "uuid",
       "status": "pending",
       "expires_at": "2026-02-22T00:00:00+00:00",
       "deletion_date": "2026-02-22",
       "course_count": 45
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Submissions List Response:**
   ```json
   {
     "submissions": [...],
     "total": 5,
     "retention_info": {
       "portal_deadline": "2026-02-15",
       "retention_days": 7,
       "deletion_date": "2026-02-22"
     },
     "note": "Submissions will be deleted 7 days after the portal deadline (2026-02-22)"
   }
   ```

#### Environment Variable:
```env
# New variable (default: 7 days)
GRADUATION_SUBMISSION_RETENTION_DAYS=7
```

---

### REQ-2: Chairperson Notification System ✅

**Requirement:** Chairpersons/Advisors receive notifications when students submit to their portals.

#### Files Created:

1. **Migration:** `database/migrations/2026_02_06_100000_create_graduation_notifications_table.php`
2. **Model:** `app/Models/GraduationNotification.php`
3. **Controller:** `app/Http/Controllers/GraduationNotificationController.php`

#### Database Schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE graduation_notifications (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    portal_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES graduation_portals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    data JSON NULL,
    read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    read_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX ON graduation_notifications (user_id);
CREATE INDEX ON graduation_notifications (portal_id);
CREATE INDEX ON graduation_notifications (type);
CREATE INDEX ON graduation_notifications (read);
CREATE INDEX ON graduation_notifications (user_id, read);
CREATE INDEX ON graduation_notifications (created_at);
```

#### API Endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/graduation-notifications` | List notifications (limit 50) |
| GET | `/api/graduation-notifications/unread-count` | Get unread count |
| POST | `/api/graduation-notifications/{id}/read` | Mark as read |
| POST | `/api/graduation-notifications/mark-all-read` | Mark all as read |
| DELETE | `/api/graduation-notifications/{id}` | Delete notification |
| DELETE | `/api/graduation-notifications/clear-read` | Delete all read notifications |

#### Notification Types:

- `new_submission` - When a student submits to a portal

#### API Response Examples:

**GET /api/graduation-notifications**
```json
{
  "notifications": [
    {
      "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "type": "new_submission",
      "title": "New Graduation Submission",
      "message": "New submission from John Doe - 6512345 in portal \"Graduation Check 2026\" with 45 courses.",
      "data": {
        "submission_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
        "student_identifier": "John Doe - 6512345",
        "course_count": 45,
        "portal_name": "Graduation Check 2026"
      },
      "read": false,
      "read_at": null,
      "created_at": "2026-02-06T10:30:00Z",
      "portal": {
        "id": "1",
        "name": "Graduation Check 2026"
      }
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

**GET /api/graduation-notifications/unread-count**
```json
{
  "unread_count": 5
}
```

**POST /api/graduation-notifications/{id}/read**
```json
{
  "message": "Notification marked as read",
  "notification": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "read": true,
    "read_at": "2026-02-06T10:35:00Z"
  }
}
```

**POST /api/graduation-notifications/mark-all-read**
```json
{
  "message": "All notifications marked as read",
  "marked_count": 5
}
```

#### How Notifications Are Created:

When a student submits, the system automatically creates notifications for:
- All **CHAIRPERSON** users in the portal's department
- All **ADVISOR** users in the portal's department

```php
// In GraduationSubmissionController::store()
GraduationNotification::notifyDepartmentStaff(
    $portal->department_id,
    $portal->id,
    $portal->name,
    $studentIdentifier,
    $submissionId,
    count($courses)
);
```

---
       {
           $notification = GraduationNotification::where('user_id', $request->user()->id)
               ->findOrFail($id);
           $notification->markAsRead();
           
           return response()->json(['message' => 'Marked as read']);
       }
       
       public function markAllAsRead(Request $request)
       {
           GraduationNotification::where('user_id', $request->user()->id)
               ->where('read', false)
               ->update(['read' => true, 'read_at' => now()]);
           
---

### REQ-3: File Pre-Validation (Frontend Only)

**Note:** This is primarily a **frontend responsibility** (client-side validation before submission).

**Frontend is responsible for:**
- File format validation (.xlsx, .xls, .csv)
- File size validation (max 5MB by default)
- File parsing (corrupt file detection)
- Required column detection
- Data type validation
- Course code format hints
- Grade format validation

Backend validation is already handled by `StoreGraduationSubmissionRequest.php`.

---

### REQ-5: Grace Period ✅

**Concept:** Students can still submit graduation files for 7 days after the portal deadline. This "Grace Period" gives students extra time while still auto-deleting data for PDPA compliance.

**Frontend Implementation (✅ Done):**
- `GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS = 7` constant added to `laravel.ts`
- Helper functions: `getGracePeriodEnd()`, `isInGracePeriod()`, `isAcceptingSubmissions()`, `getDaysUntilGracePeriodEnd()`
- Portal selection: portals in grace period shown with amber badge "Grace Period" and countdown
- Upload step: amber banner warning that submission is during grace period
- Preview/success steps: retention messages reference grace period end date
- Chairperson portal page: info alert mentions grace period

**Backend Implementation (✅ Done):**

1. **Config (`config/graduation.php`):**
   ```php
   'grace_period_days' => (int) env('GRADUATION_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS', 7),
   ```

2. **Model (`GraduationPortal.php`):**
   - `isActive()` — returns `true` during grace period (not just before deadline)
   - `scopeActive()` — includes portals in grace period in listings
   - `getGracePeriodEnd()` — returns `Carbon` of `deadline + grace_period_days`
   - `isInGracePeriod()` — returns `true` if now is between deadline and grace period end

3. **Portal API responses now include:**
   ```json
   {
     "deadline": "2026-02-15",
     "grace_period_end": "2026-02-22T00:00:00.000000Z",
     "is_in_grace_period": true
   }
   ```
   Note: `deadline` stays in `Y-m-d` format. `grace_period_end` uses ISO 8601.

4. **Submission Endpoint (`POST /api/graduation-portals/{id}/submit`):**
   - Accepts submissions when `now <= portal.deadline + grace_period_days`
   - Rejects with 422 + `GRACE_PERIOD_ENDED` error code when past grace period
   - Retention/deletion date is still `portal.deadline + submission_retention_days`

5. **Submissions List (`GET .../cache-submissions`) — `retention_info` now includes:**
   ```json
   { "is_in_grace_period": true }
   ```

6. **PDPA Note:** Grace period submissions follow the same retention policy (deleted `retention_days` after portal deadline). The grace period only extends the *submission window*, not the *data retention window*.

---

### REQ-6: Enhanced Validation Response ✅

**Requirement:** The chairperson's submission review page should show the same level of detail as the student progress page.

**Frontend Implementation (✅ Done):**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `DonutChart` | Multi-segment SVG donut showing credit distribution (completed/in-progress/planned/failed/remaining) |
| `SegmentedProgressBar` | Gradient bar with legend showing credit progress toward required total |
| GPA Calculation | Client-side GPA from `GRADE_GPA_MAP` (A=4.0, B+=3.5, ..., F=0) |
| Stats Row | 6 stat cards: Total Courses, Completed, In Progress, Planned, Credits Earned, GPA |
| Credit Breakdown | Side-by-side: donut chart + itemized credit rows with color indicators |
| Course Lists | 4 collapsible sections: Completed (with grades), In Progress (with semester), Planned (with semester), Failed/Withdrawn |
| Requirements Checklist | Uses `validation.requirements[]` from backend to show met/unmet checklist |
| Validation Summary | Uses `validation.summary` for matched/unmatched courses, required credits |

**Backend Implementation (✅ Done):**

The `POST .../cache-submissions/{id}/validate` response now returns:

```json
{
  "message": "Validation completed",
  "submission": {
    "id": "uuid", "status": "validated",
    "student_identifier": "...", "curriculum_id": "...",
    "courses": [...], "submitted_at": "...", "expires_at": "...", "deletion_date": "..."
  },
  "validation": {
    "valid": true,
    "can_graduate": true,
    "canGraduate": true,
    "summary": {
      "totalCreditsRequired": 120, "totalCreditsEarned": 95,
      "creditsCompleted": 95, "creditsInProgress": 15, "creditsPlanned": 6,
      "completionPercentage": 79.2, "gpa": 3.20,
      "matchedCourses": 30, "unmatchedCourses": 2,
      "coursesMatched": 30, "coursesUnmatched": 2
    },
    "categoryProgress": { "Core": { "creditsRequired": 60, "creditsCompleted": 45, ... } },
    "requirements": [
      { "name": "Minimum Credits", "met": false, "label": "...", "description": "...", "message": "...", "required": 120, "current": 95 },
      { "name": "GPA Requirement", "met": true, ... }
    ],
    "errors": [], "warnings": [],
    "matchedCourses": [ { "code": "CS101", "name": "...", "credits": 3, "grade": "A", "status": "completed", "semester": "1/2025", "category": "Core", "matched": true } ],
    "unmatchedCourses": [ { "code": "BUS201", "name": "...", "credits": 3, "grade": "B+", "status": "completed", "reason": "Not in curriculum" } ]
  }
}
```

**Key decisions (reviewed Feb 11, 2026):**
- `validation_result` stays in cached submission (for `show()` endpoint)
- Top-level `validation` key used in validate response (for frontend)
- `requirements` is an indexed array (not keyed object)
- `unmatchedCourses` kept as objects (not stripped to strings)
- `deadline` format stays `Y-m-d` (no ISO 8601 change)
- `matchedCourses` stripped internal IDs (`is_required`, `curriculum_course_id`, `course_id`) — frontend confirmed safe

---

### REQ-4: Auto Curriculum Mapping (DEFERRED)

**Status:** Deferred for future consideration.

**Backend Requirements (for future):**
1. Student ID pattern configuration per department
2. Batch-to-curriculum mapping table
3. API endpoint: `GET /api/resolve-curriculum?student_id={id}&department_id={uuid}`
4. Fallback to manual selection when auto-mapping fails

---

## 1. Executive Summary

The **Graduation Portal** allows students to submit their course progress for graduation eligibility review. The system is designed with **PDPA compliance** - student data is stored temporarily and automatically deleted 1 week after the portal deadline.

### Key Features
- **Public portal access** - Students don't need accounts
- **PIN-based authentication** - Secure session tokens after PIN verification
- **Time-bound submissions** - Auto-expires 1 week after portal deadline (PDPA compliant)
- **Chairperson notifications** - Discord-style notification dropdown for new submissions
- **File pre-validation** - Format and data validation before submission
- **Curriculum validation** - Automatic validation against curriculum requirements

---

### 5.2 State Management

```typescript
interface GraduationWizardState {
  // Step 1
  portalId: string | null;
  portalName: string | null;
  
  // Step 2
  sessionToken: string | null;
  sessionExpiresAt: string | null;  // ISO datetime
  
  // Step 3
  curriculumId: string | null;
  curriculumName: string | null;
  
  // Step 4
  parsedCourses: Course[] | null;
  fileName: string | null;
  
  // Step 5
  studentIdentifier: string | null;
  
  // Step 6/7
  submissionId: string | null;
  submissionExpiresAt: string | null;
}

interface Course {
  code: string;        // "CS 101"
  name?: string;       // "Introduction to Computing"
  credits: number;     // 3
  grade?: string;      // "A", "B+", "IP", "P" - OPTIONAL for planned courses
  status: "completed" | "in_progress" | "planned" | "failed" | "withdrawn";
  semester?: string;   // "1/2024"
  category?: string;   // "Core", "Major Elective"
}
```

### 5.3 Grade to Status Mapping

```typescript
const gradeToStatus = (grade: string | null): CourseStatus => {
  if (!grade) return 'planned';
  
  const passingGrades = ['A', 'A-', 'B+', 'B', 'B-', 'C+', 'C', 'C-', 'D+', 'D', 'D-', 'S', 'P'];
  const inProgressGrades = ['IP', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'TAKING', 'CURRENT'];
  const withdrawnGrades = ['W'];
  const failedGrades = ['F'];
  
  const upperGrade = grade.toUpperCase();
  
  if (passingGrades.includes(upperGrade)) return 'completed';
  if (inProgressGrades.includes(upperGrade)) return 'in_progress';
  if (withdrawnGrades.includes(upperGrade)) return 'withdrawn';
  if (failedGrades.includes(upperGrade)) return 'failed';
  
  return 'planned';
};
```

### 5.4 Session Expiry Handling

```typescript
// Start countdown after PIN verification
useEffect(() => {
  if (!sessionExpiresAt) return;
  
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    const remaining = new Date(sessionExpiresAt).getTime() - Date.now();
    
    if (remaining <= 0) {
      clearInterval(interval);
      showToast("Session expired. Please re-enter PIN.");
      redirectToStep(2);
    } else if (remaining <= 60000) {
      showWarning("Session expires in less than 1 minute!");
    }
  }, 1000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, [sessionExpiresAt]);
```

## 6. Curriculum Selection Flow

### 6.1 Scenario A: Portal has department assigned (common)

```typescript
// After PIN verification, fetch curricula
const { curricula, total, default_curriculum_id, portal_department_id } = 
  await fetch(`/api/public/graduation-portals/${portalId}/curricula`).then(r => r.json());

if (total > 0) {
  // Show curriculum selection cards
  // Pre-select the one with is_default: true
  setCurricula(curricula);
  setSelectedCurriculum(default_curriculum_id);
}
```

### 6.2 Scenario B: Portal has no department (fallback)

```typescript
if (total === 0 && !portal_department_id) {
  // Step 1: Fetch faculties
  const { faculties } = await fetch('/api/public/faculties').then(r => r.json());
  
  // Step 2: User selects faculty
  // Step 3: Fetch departments for selected faculty
  const { departments } = await fetch(
    `/api/public/departments?faculty_id=${selectedFacultyId}`
  ).then(r => r.json());
  
  // Step 4: User selects department
  // Step 5: Fetch curricula with department filter
  const { curricula } = await fetch(
    `/api/public/graduation-portals/${portalId}/curricula?department_id=${selectedDeptId}`
  ).then(r => r.json());
  
  // Step 6: User selects curriculum
}
```

## 6.3 File Pre-Validation (NEW)

Before allowing submission, validate the uploaded file client-side:

### Validation Rules

```typescript
interface FileValidationResult {
  valid: boolean;
  errors: FileValidationError[];
  warnings: FileValidationWarning[];

  // 4. Structure validation - check required columns
  const requiredColumns = ['code', 'name', 'credits'];

      });
    }
    
    // Grade validation (if present)
    const grade = row.grade?.toString().trim().toUpperCase();
    const validGrades = ['A', 'A-', 'B+', 'B', 'B-', 'C+', 'C', 'C-', 'D+', 'D', 'D-', 'F', 'S', 'U', 'P', 'W', 'IP', 'I', ''];
    if (grade && !validGrades.includes(grade)) {

## 8.4 Chairperson Notification System (NEW)

A Discord-style notification dropdown for chairpersons to receive real-time updates about new submissions.

### Notification Data Structure

```typescript
interface GraduationNotification {

  timestamp: string;             // ISO datetime
  read: boolean;
  data: {                        // Additional context for routing
    submission_id?: string;
    student_identifier?: string;
  };

### Placement in Layout

The notification bell should be placed in the chairperson's header/navbar:

```tsx
// In chairperson layout header
<header className="flex items-center justify-between px-4 py-2">
  <Logo />
  <nav>{/* navigation items */}</nav>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
    <NotificationDropdown />  {/* ← Add here */}
    <UserMenu />
  </div>
</header>
```

---

## 12. PDPA Compliance Notes

1. **No Permanent Storage**: Student submissions are stored in cache only (not database)
2. **Time-Bound Retention**: Submissions auto-delete 1 week after portal deadline
3. **PIN Hashing**: PINs are hashed with bcrypt
4. **IP Validation**: Optional IP verification for session security
5. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute-force PIN attempts
6. **Audit Logging**: Actions are logged for accountability (without PII)

---

## 13. Testing Commands

```bash
# List all graduation routes
php artisan route:list --path=graduation

# Test model instantiation
php artisan tinker --execute="new \App\Models\GraduationPortal(); new \App\Models\GraduationPortalLog();"

# Check config values
php artisan tinker --execute="config('graduation');"

# Clear cache (useful during development)
php artisan cache:clear
```

## 15. Future Considerations

### 15.1 Auto Curriculum Mapping (DEFERRED)

> ⚠️ **Status:** Deferred for future implementation  
> **Requested:** February 6, 2026  
> **Reason:** Requires additional backend support and student ID pattern analysis

**Requirement:**  
Automatically map student IDs to their correct curriculum instead of letting students manually select. This would reduce human error in curriculum selection.

**Proposed Implementation:**
1. Extract batch/year from student ID (e.g., `6512345` → batch `65` → year 2022)
2. Match batch to department-specific curriculum rules
3. Auto-select the appropriate curriculum based on:
   - Student ID prefix/batch number
   - Department the portal belongs to
   - Active curriculum for that batch

**Considerations:**
- Different departments may have different ID patterns
- Some students may have transferred or changed programs
- Edge cases: students retaking, delayed graduation, etc.
- May need a "Override curriculum" option for edge cases

**Backend Requirements (when implemented):**
- API endpoint to resolve curriculum from student ID
- Curriculum-batch mapping configuration
- Fallback to manual selection when auto-mapping fails
